# Real-Time-Face-Mask-Detection-Model

## Frameworks Used
1. OpenCV
2. Keras
3. Caffe based Face Detection Model

## Description
This model used a sample size of around 3500 images of people with and without mask.
This enabled it to have very high accuracy in its predictions.

We can use this in real-world applications/scenarios which require face-mask-detection for safety purposes due to the ongoing pandemic. Distributed Systems in Airports,Railway stations, colleges and other public places can integrate this to ensure that safety guidelines are followed.
